Bathroom finder by location. Focused on the needs of the person.

* Google Maps, Mapbox or another Map API.
* Refuge Restrooms API, or possibly build one from scratch if needed.
* React, Redux, Sass, Webpack, JavaScript.

##### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
* A form that allows visitors to add a bathroom and it's appropriate features.
